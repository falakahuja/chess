## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Create a Room**  
   A player enters a name and creates a room. A 6-letter room code is generated and shared.

2. **Join a Room**  
   The second player uses the room code to join. The game starts automatically when both players are in.

3. **Play Chess**  
   Players make valid moves, which are synced in real-time via WebSockets.

4. **Chat**  
   A built-in chat panel allows players to communicate during the game.

5. **Game Over**  
   The app automatically detects checkmate, draw, or resign situations and displays the result.
